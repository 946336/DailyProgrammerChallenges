# How to Contribute

If you want to contribute to this repository, you can either contribute to challenges or solutions


### Challenges

Here are some of the known issues with the repository that you could potentially help with:

- Missing Challenges
- Inconsistency between title formatting i.e. `[hard] vs [Hard] vs [Difficult]`, ordering of words, lowercase vs uppercase letters, etc (take a look at the challenge names to see the inconsistencies)
- Missing selftext for some challenge titles (Issue #4)


### Solutions

This repository's main purpose is to serve as an external repo for r/dailyprogrammer challenges. However, with the help of others, we can build a solution bank for each challenge.

In order to submit your solution, go to the directory of the challenge you've solved, and add your solution with the following format `solution.<filetype>`, to the `solutions/` folder (please add it in if it does not already exist). The best thing to do is to try and build a **diverse** solution bank, meaning solutions in different programming languages. 

However, if you see that there is an existing solution in the language you used, you can still add your solution so long as you add it under the name `solutionX.<filetype>`, where X is an integer representing the Xth solution after the first solution.

Example:
```
solution.py
solution1.py
solution2.py
...
solutionX.py
```
